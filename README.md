# Chat Application

## Introduction
Hi! Ever feel like anonymity is lost within today's online world? Ever want to talk to people safely just for fun? 
<br>
That's where this application comes in! Chatting in this online room is safe and protected for you.
<br>
Choose your own nickname, or leave it as anonymous. We don't track any messages or personal info.
<br>
The only thing we check is the ID that is set from your browser, and that changes every time you refresh your page.
<br>
This is done so we can service you to everyone else, making sure that someone is connected and wants to talk to someone else.
<br>
Check below to learn more about the specifics of this application, and have fun messaging others!

### What is this?
As explained above, this is a chat application with the core idea of connecting people, with safety and anynoimity.
<br>
This is a lot of people, just want to message other people about virtually anything, but without knowing someone is tracking
<br>
them, a company is gaining information on who they are, or just don't care about who is on the other side of the screen.
<br>
The only thing that this application checks, is your username that you set, and the ID appears when you load the page.
<br>
Again, as detailed above, the ID is only for allowing the server to communicate with other ID's, to show that people
<br>
are actually in the room. The ID changes everytime you refresh the page, meaning nothing can be traced.
